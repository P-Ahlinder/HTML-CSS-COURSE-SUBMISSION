                  This is question that you’ve probably had to deal with on a regular basis. The answer is no. IT
                  managers and support staff to not know what your password is. And they should never be willing to tell
                  you any password via email, over the phone or even in person. This poses a huge security risk and a
                  possible violation of your company’s IT security policy. If you just can’t remember your password and
                  need help, then ask the IT support to help you reset your password. You’ll have to create a new
                  password to replace the one that’s been forgotten.

                  It is possible for your phone to be infected with a virus. You may notice things such as strange
                  charges on your phone bill, for things you haven’t done. Your phone’s battery may all of a sudden not
                  last as long as it used to. You may also notice ads popping up on the phone’s browser. These are all
                  signs that your phone could be infected. You can avoid some of these viruses with the use of mobile
                  malware and antivirus applications. These are made for Android phones and others.

                  They’re definitely scams. If you receive a call from anyone claiming to be from Microsoft tech
                  support, hang up right away. Microsoft does not make unsolicited phone calls to fix computer or other
                  issues. They also will not call and ask for personal or financial information. In addition, they will
                  not contact you via unsolicited emails. Scammers will call posing as Microsoft reps. They’ll say
                  something like your computer has a problem, a virus, or missing software, etc. Their goal is to get
                  your personal and financial information, or to have you download malware onto your device. These are
                  scam calls—so do not even talk to them, and don’t be polite. Just hang up to avoid accidentally
                  falling for the scam.

                <div class="accordion-body">
                  The short answer is yes! However, any cloud service can come with problems. Dropbox is a powerful tool
                  used by individuals and businesses every day to back up and store important information. Thankfully
                  it’s a service that’s backed by a dedicated security team. However, with that said, hackers have begun
                  playing on the service’s popularity and widespread use. Every so often, they will send out phishing
                  emails. These are emails that are made to look as if they are from Dropbox. The aim is to steal user
                  passwords and to infect devices with malware. Dropbox is generally safe; however, be watchful of any
                  email you receive from the company. Look carefully to see if the email: Asks that you replay with your
                  username/email and password Contains links—these could be links to fake login pages, where criminals
                  can steal your username & password Says that you’ve won a prize or a special deal, or claim action is
                  urgent, etc. These are all signs of a scam. Never click on the link contained in an email that appears
                  to be suspicious. Instead, go directly to the company’s website and sign in and check for messages.
                  Another option is to call the company directly, but not using any phone number in the email Instead,
                  use a phone number listed on the company’s site, then call and see if the email is real or not.

                  Yes, it’s necessary in this day and age of hackers and cyberattacks. Regularly changing your password
                  prevents hackers and others from accessing your private data. It’s also important to avoid using the
                  same password across numerous services. Using the same password makes it easy for hackers to figure
                  out what your password is on another service, such as social media, your email, online bill paying and
                  banking, etc.

                  Many people are still confused about exactly what the cloud is and how it works. They hear files are
                  stored in the cloud, but don’t really understand what that means. The cloud is software that runs on
                  the Internet, rather than your own device. It’s a place that stores data for you including files,
                  photos, and more. Examples of cloud services include Google Drive, Apple iCloud, Dropbox, Microsoft
                  Office 365 and more. The cloud makes it easy and fast to access your files and data from any device.
                  You can upload a file to the cloud service you prefer, and then access it with your phone, etc.

                  This question may refer to the use of public WiFi and apps on the phone. The answer is a little bit
                  involved. In short, public WiFi is easily hacked by criminals looking to steal personal data. By using
                  a public WiFi, you could be exposing data that can access online accounts, making it easy for
                  criminals to hack your identity. If you must use public WiFi, then be sure to use an excellent paid
                  VPN (virtual private network) service. Look for VPN providers that don’t keep log files, use strong
                  encryption to keep your Internet connection private, prevent DNS leakage and more.

                  While most websites are safe and legitimate, there are many that are not. You may inadvertently choose
                  a website that looks valid and real, only to find out your data was stolen after uploading a file. In
                  addition, if you’d like to save files such as important documents and photos, it’s best to choose a
                  reliable cloud service, rather than a site such as Facebook, etc. These are some of the most common IT
                  support questions—we hope the answers have offered some good advice on what to look for in malicious
                  sites, how to stay safe online and more.
